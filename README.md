In the current healthcare environment, the patient records are locked in multiple centralized systems which are maintained by the different healthcare institution. So, the complete, comprehensive medical data history of the patient is locked away making it difficult for doctors in making informed decisions. Our system aims at tackling these issues using a decentralized system to store the patient record. The patient and the doctor/healthcare institutions use a Decentralized Application as an interface to the Blockchain network. When a patient visits the doctor the patient can give access to his/her medical data through this Decentralized Application via an Ethereum smart contract. Once the patient gives access, the doctor can access all the patient's medical records and history in one unified interface. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are used to give a tailored medical experience to the patients. With rich and deep data that is available from the users' network can be fed into the Machine Learning models to do various levels of analysis to give patients and doctors further insight over the medical records.

## :computer: Usage:


   1. Run following commands to get started
	   ```
	   git clone https://github.com/anushakalyani/anushakalyani.github.io.git
	   ```
	   * Some packages usages might change so you should run npm prune & npm install often. A common way to update is by doing
	  ```
	  npm prune
	  ``` 
	  ```
	  npm install
	  ```
* To start running the app in the development mode run the following command.   This opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser after which you can start using this application.
		  ```
		  npm start
		  ```
